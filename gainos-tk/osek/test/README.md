###test16  Failed
	GetResource for Non-preematble task was not supported by gainos-tk
	As I think,if a task is non-preemtable,it seems that it will get the RES_SCHEDULER when 
	start to run. A Non-preemtable task is treated as a task that has an internal resource 
	linked to RES_SCHEDULER in gainos-tk.

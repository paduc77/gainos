 * A Hth has three hardware Tx buffers.But I don't know how to use the 3 Tx buffers
 * among different PduId handler.So the rule below was used to simply implement it:
 * When a PduId AAA send a frame though Hth0 and not finished, then PduId BBB also want to
 * send a frame through Hth0,then it's not allowed.but if any of the 3 Tx buffers of Hth0
 * is empty,then PduId AAA can use Hth0,So PduId AAA can send messages consecutively.
 * PduId BBB can start to use Hth0 only when all of the 3 Tx buffers is empty.*/
